In the minimum cut problem, our task is to remove a set of edges from the graph
such that there will be no path from the source to the sink after the removal and
the total weight of the removed edges is minimum.
Maximum flow
In the maximum flow problem, our task is to send as much flow as possible
from the source to the sink. The weight of each edge is a capacity that restricts
the flow that can go through the edge. In each intermediate node, the incoming
and outgoing flow has to be equal.

the maximum size of a flow and the minimum size
of a cut are the same in the above example. It turns out that a maximum flow
and a minimum cut are always equally large,
