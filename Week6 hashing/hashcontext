one way has function md4, md5, sha0 
hashing not good for critical things like air traffic , pacemaker etc where red black will prove better

if someone knows hash function he can do ddos attack

seperate chaining -less prone to clustering
linear probing-> less space wasted

2 probe hasing -hash to two positions , insert key in shorter of 2 chains
reduces length to log log n

double hashing: -to remove clustering
use linear probing but not skip 1 , variable number each time
delete is difficult to implement

Cuckoo hashing - hash to two positions if one is occupied go into another

Nowadays little extra memory is ok

main reason to use hash table instead of rb tree is : they have better performance in practic e on typical inputs
