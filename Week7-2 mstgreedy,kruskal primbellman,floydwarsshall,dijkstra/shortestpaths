3 types 
1)source to destination
2)single source: from one vertex to all //most common
3)all pairs: between all pairs

Edge weights
1) non negative
2)random weights
3)euclidean weights

cycles:assumption(no direction cycle, no negative cycles)
allow self loop and parallel edges
representation like directed graph , better create structure to handle
