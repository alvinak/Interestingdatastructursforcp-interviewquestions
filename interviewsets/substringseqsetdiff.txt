substring
subsequence
subset


for string "abcdef"
a substring is continuous stream of characters: hence "bcd" is a substring but "bde" is not

a subsequence is non continuous stream but here order is maintained , hence bcd, bde are subsequence but ebd is not , because order is not maintained

subset is any character in any order  hence bcd,bde,ebd are subset

all substring are subsequence and all subsequence are subset
