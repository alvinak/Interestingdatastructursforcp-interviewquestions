Cube solving basic
Step 1: make white daisy
Step 2:first layer:- match corners in first layer using left or right trigger . eg right trigger= R U R' ; Left trigger = L' U' L. If whiete is in top layer bring it to a place where it directly
coinicide with unmatched white bottom then do  left or right trigger accordingly
Step 3:Second layer:- to solve second layer match top edge with center, top edge should be 2 colored with no yellow in it .Once matched check top color , if it matches with color on right, use right hand to movetop of cube to left side(U) , then perform right trigger, then match white which is displaced.
Similar case for left trigger
Exception : a situation in which the cube will be in mid layer for this do right or left trigger first then solve

Step 4:yellow daisy on top   F + RUR'U' + F' for inverted L , when 3 yellow are alighned put them in horizontal position and apply same algorithm

Step 5: yellow top layer
for 0 or 2 yellow color 
First move yellow stickers towards left side 

Use Sune algorithm R U R' U R U2 R'
if fish or 1 yellow color on corners
rotate fish so its mouth is bottom left then use sune

Step 6: Orient corners of top layer 
t perm
L' U R U' L U R' R U R' U R U2 R'
alight corner colors with center

Step 7 Position the edges of top layer
