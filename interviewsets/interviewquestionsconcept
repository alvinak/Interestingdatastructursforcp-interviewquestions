Early Binding (compile-time time polymorphism) As the name indicates, compiler (or linker) directly associate an address to the function call. It replaces the call with a machine language instruction that tells the mainframe to leap to the address of the function.fn overloading , operator overloading


Late Binding(virtual functions)->binds object at runtime
(by doing the virtual function)
done by function overriding
base *bp;
derived d;
bptr= &d;

virtual functions do late binding , lookup table,static array which compiler creates at compile time
*_vptr

what does malloc return
