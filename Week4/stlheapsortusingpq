default c++ priorty queue is in decreasing order
priority_queue<int> q;
q.push(3);
q.push(5);
q.push(7);
q.push(2);
cout << q.top() << "\n"; // 7
q.pop();
cout << q.top() << "\n"; // 5


priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> q; (Ascending order)
since this syntax is difficult to remember we can multiply by -1 and then use normal priorty queue
Insertion and removal take O(logn) time,
and retrieval takes O(1) time.
